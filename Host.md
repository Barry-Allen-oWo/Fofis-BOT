# 🍒 Host

My HOST used at the moment for 🌹 Fofis 🌹 is Replit, I recommend it, because the UptimeRobot and Express Service work correctly, which is very necessary to keep BOT's online as always, the Hostels do not like it installed by the Terminal, so leave a Library Search Tab that you actually use as an example Discord.js
